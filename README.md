## Introduction

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for a class activity one.

In this class we will use GitHub for all course materials and most of the assignments. We will also use Markdown for writing. This activity invites students to explore the use of GitHub and to learn to use Markdown language as they reflect on an assigned article.

## Tasks

 - First, please familiarize yourself with GitHub. For example, [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) provides a good reference guide.

 -  Then, clone your lab  repository locally to your computer. To do so, click on "Code" button in your lab  repository's Web page, then make sure "HTTPS" is selected (unless you have previously set up SSH keys), and copy the displayed command.

 - Next, open your terminal window, navigate to a folder/directory where you would like to store this course's materials, and paste the command you copied in a previous step.

 - Now you can explore Markdown by using [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as a guide. You can also watch a video on [Markdown Tidbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdJEUAy5IyA&list=PLsYZRXov75ZHSwWiCk0-jd1RcTuu_-zmD&index=5).

 - Next, find `reflection.md` file in your lab  repository. After reading the article titled [Twelve Million Phones, One Dataset, Zero Privacy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html), reflect on the article using prompts given in the reflection file.

 - Next complete the `twoArticles.md` portion of this work.


 - Finally, `commit` and `push` your work to GitHub by typing commands below one by one in your terminal window. Please make sure you are in your lab  directory when you type these commands.

	- `git add .` OR 	`git add -A`

	- `git commit -m "Replace this text with your own commit message"`

	- `git push`

 - Refresh your Web browser with your repository on GitHub and make sure that you see your changes have been committed correctly.


 - Do not use a word processor such as Google Docs, Word or Libreoffice for your writing. Instead, please write in a text file using the Markdown styling syntax.

## GitHub and Markdown
 If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
